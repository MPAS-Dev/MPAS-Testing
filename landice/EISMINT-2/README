EISMINT-2 Test Cases


*** Included files:

* namelist.input.periodic_hex is used for running periodic_hex to create a grid for the test case.  It needs to be renamed to 'namelist.input' to run periodic_hex if mesh needs to be generated.  If you downloaded a tar archive of this test case, you do not need to create the mesh and can ignore this file.

* setup_initial_conditions_EISMINT2.py
This file is used to setup the initial conditions for the test case.  Run it with the -e option to choose which experiment to setup.  Valid experiments are A-D, F.


*** In each experiment directory:

* namelist.landice is used for running the  MPAS land ice core. 

* streams.landice is used for specifying file input/output settings for the model.


*** Instructions:
Run './setup_initial_conditions_EISMINT2.py -e EXP' where EXP is the experiment name to setup the simulation initial condition in the corresponding subdirectory.

Symlink or copy the landice_model executable into this directory and then change to the directory of the experiment you would like to run.  Execute the model from there:
> ../landice_model                (for a 1 processor job)
> mpirun -np 4 ../landice_model   (for a 4 processor job)
