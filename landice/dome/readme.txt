Dome Test Case


namelist.input.periodic_hex is used for running periodic_hex to create a grid for the dome test case.
namelist.input.land_ice is used for actually running dome test case in the MPAS land ice core.


These namelist files need to be moved/renamed as necessary to execute the various steps outlined in the Quick Start Guide.

Eventually a script may be created to automate the various steps.
