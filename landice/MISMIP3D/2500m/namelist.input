! MISMIP3D Elmer output uses 2.5 km spacing.
   dc = 2500.,
! Domain is 800 km wide, standard hex mesh has dx=dc. so nx=321 + 2 for stripping off periodicity.
   nx = 323,
! Half domain is 50 km tall but we are not dealing with reflective boundaries, so our domain is 100 km tall. standard hex mesh has dy=0.866*dc.  So ny=48 + 2 for stripping off periodicity.
   ny = 50,
   nVertLevels = 1,
! The mesh will need culling to remove periodicity, so no need to build decomps now.
   nproc = 1
